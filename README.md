Title: Malaria Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network on Blood Cell Images

This project is the result of collaboration among group members, and the comprehensive research findings have been published in the form of a journal, accessible through this [link](https://journal-stiayappimakassar.ac.id/index.php/srj/article/view/853). The entire malaria dataset, comprised of 2400 images, can be obtained from Kaggle and is available for download at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria/data).

The dataset is divided as follows:

- Training Data: 1350
- Validation Data: 450
- Test Data: 600

The classification involves two classes:

0: 'Parasitized'
1: 'Uninfectedâ€™

The classification process is divided into two phases: one with augmentation and one without augmentation. This division aims to achieve high accuracy without encountering overfitting issues.
